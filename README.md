# Template for Local Packages: Part 1
This repository contains a basic example as a template for the intended package structure. 
It is layed out such that it can also be used to install from a local dir or git.
See [Part 2](https://github.com/trowraic/local-install-of-package) for a repository containing more info on how to use this.

See for example [this](https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/minimal.html) for another short example and a little more info on what is important.
